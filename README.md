# SnakeinMinecraft
This porject was inspired by Fundy's video where he created Snake in Minecraft. I wanted to see if I could do something similar and did.
Use /snakepos1 and /snakepos2 to specify the area for the arena and /arena to generate it.
The tail will grow whenever the snake runs into any living entity including players so this would be a great minigame to play with friendes.
